// Import the cookie/request helpers from the `@tanstack/start-server-core/request-response`
// subpath, NOT the package root or the `@tanstack/react-start/server` barrel that
// re-exports it. Those roots pull in `createStartHandler`, which references the
// per-app virtual modules `#tanstack-router-entry` / `#tanstack-start-entry`; when a
// downstream app pre-bundles this SDK as a dependency (e.g. Vite's dep optimizer),
// those specifiers cannot be resolved and the consumer's `vite dev`/build fails
// during dependency optimization. The roots also drag in the SSR renderer
// (renderRouterToString → react-dom/server), which would bloat a client bundle that
// transitively reaches this module and break hydration. The `/request-response`
// subpath exposes the same helpers with neither problem — and start-server-core is a
// direct dependency of @tanstack/react-start, so it is always present.

 * Bridges `@auth0/auth0-server-js`'s {@link CookieHandler} contract onto
 * TanStack Start's request/response cookie utilities.
 *
 * Unlike the Nuxt/Fastify adapters, no `storeOptions` (event/request/reply)
 * needs to be threaded through: TanStack Start resolves the current request
 * implicitly via its own server-side context (`getRequest()` / `getH3Event()`),
 * so `getCookie`/`setCookie`/`deleteCookie` already operate on the in-flight
 * request. This keeps every server call site free of request plumbing.
 *
 * `storeOptions` is therefore unused here. The type parameter is `void` to make
 * that explicit while still satisfying the generic interface.
